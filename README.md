    rake kitchen:all                  # Run all test instances
    rake kitchen:default-ubuntu-1204  # Run default-ubuntu-1204 test instance
    rake lint                         # Lint Chef cookbooks
    rake rubocop                      # Run rubocop tests
    rake spec                         # Run ChefSpec examples
